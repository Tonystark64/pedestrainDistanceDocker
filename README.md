# Pedestrain Distance Calculator in Docker
We used [opendatacam](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam) to detect pedestrains and from the generated JSON file we calculated the distance between people, displayed the edited video in the web browser through flask module then containerizes the whole App.  

### As shown in below screenshot, the distances between people are tagged with numbers.
